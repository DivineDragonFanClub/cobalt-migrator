# cobalt-migrator

This tool can convert non-Cobalt 2.0.0 romfs mods to be Cobalt v0.34.1 compatible.

Get the latest version [here](https://github.com/DivineDragonFanClub/cobalt-migrator/releases).

# How to use
Download the latest release and extract it anywhere. Then, have the mod folder you want to convert ready.

> [!NOTE]  
> The mod folder you want to convert should have a `romfs` in it. 
> For example, if your mod is `My Awesome Mod`, it should have the `romfs` in it like `My Awesome Mod\romfs`.

## How to use for Windows
Drag the `My Awesome Mod folder` onto the .exe.

## How to use for Mac
Using terminal, run ./cobalt-migrator `<path to mod folder with romfs in it>`

If the conversion is successful, there will be a new version of your mod with (Cobalt) after the name, such as `My Awesome Mod (Cobalt)`. You can then install it by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Raytwo/Cobalt/wiki/Managing-your-Mods)
